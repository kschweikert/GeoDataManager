# GeoDataManager
The Geodata Manager is a desktop utility for viewing metadata about geospatial files. It allows viewing metadata and adding tags for organization to added local folders. 
It maintains two csv file databases for remembering the added folders and files with tags. 

Reading of geospatial metadata is dependent on the python osgeo libraries gdal and ogr. https://gdal.org/api/python.html
